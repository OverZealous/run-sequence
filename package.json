This function is designed to solve the situation where you have defined run-order, but choose not to or cannot use dependencies.\n\nYou can still run some of the tasks in parallel, by providing an array of task names.\n\nIf the final argument is a function, it will be used as a callback after all the functions are either finished or an error has occurred.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYou must call the exported function with your gulp instance.\n\n```javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar runSequence = require('gulp-run-sequence')(gulp);\nvar clean = require('gulp-clean');\n\ngulp.task('build', function(cb) {\n  runSequence('build-clean', ['build-scripts', 'build-styles'], 'build-html', cb);\n});\n\n// configure build-clean, build-scripts, build-styles, build-html as you\n// wish, but make sure they either return a stream or handle the callback\n\ngulp.task('build-clean', function() {\n\treturn gulp.src('build').pipe(clean());\n});\n\n```\n\nLICENSE\n-------\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 [Phil DeJarnett](http://overzealous.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
